                <p >Strong documentation, public sharing, and other open science practices are recognized as desirable
                    but are not often rewarded.
                    Receiving credit for contributions to the research lifecycle can incentivize researchers to increase the transparency
                    of their work.</p>
                <p> Open Research Badges are a mechanism for giving that credit.
                    Badges are digital credentials&mdash;they are issued to an individual or group of individuals by a verifying
                    body such as a journal or other organization. Badges can be displayed on a manuscript, resume, or a
                    personal profile as a sign that the researcher practices open science. </p>

                    <p>Presently, there are two badging initiatives, each designed to award various open practices.
                        These badges are available for any organization or publisher to award.</p>

                                    public sharing of data and materials and the pre-registration of studies. They are issued
                                    to individual manuscripts by participating journals.</p>
